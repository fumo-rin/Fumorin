Reisen: So you've finally made it... I see why they call you the Strongest.
Cirno: Yes, i was chosen to defeat you!
Reisen: What!
Reisen: No no, this is some kind of mistake... I just wanted this sweet hat!
Cirno: It is a sweet hat.
Reisen: We could just pretend to fight and you could let me go yes-yes?
Reisen: I don't want to get beat up by the strongest.
Cirno: I suppose.
Reisen: Ok, ill strike first and then you strike me, and i will let you win.
